This repository demonstrates a common error in React when using the useState hook: directly modifying the state variable instead of using the setter function.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  This mistake prevents React from correctly updating the component's UI and can lead to unexpected behavior or silent errors.
